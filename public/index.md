---

## App 1: Formulary & Patient Education

1. Within <a href="https://dzd_bv47inn29chvps.sagemaker.us-west-2.on.aws/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SageMaker Unified</a>, under **Build**, where it says *Generative AI app development with Amazon Bedrock*, choose *Build chat agent*.
![Build chat agent button](/images/unified-build-chat-agent.png)
2. When prompted to select a project, choose **thma-lab** and click continue.
3. On the new screen, rename the app: **Formulary Assistant YOUR INITIALS**. (You cannot copy and paste this; you will need to manually type the name of the app.)

### Configurations

#### Model

1. Choose **Palmyra X5** from the dropdown.

> Palmyra X5 (Writer) is an enterprise LLM designed for dependable, grounded outputs and controllable behavior in missionâ€‘critical workflows. It excels at instruction following, summarization, and extraction with a focus on accuracy, safety, and compliance in regulated settings.

2. Click the *Save* button in the top right. Make sure to do this periodically over the course of the lab.

#### System prompt

> **What is a System Prompt?**  
> A system prompt is the initial instruction set that defines how your AI assistant should behave, communicate, and respond to users. Think of it as giving your AI assistant a job description and personality guide. It sets boundaries for what the AI should and shouldn't do, establishes the tone of communication (like speaking at a 6th-8th grade reading level for patient education), and ensures consistent, safe responses aligned with your healthcare organization's policies.

1. In the *Enter a system prompt* field, enter the following:

```text
You are a pharmacy assistant for formulary questions and patientâ€‘friendly education. Use ONLY the knowledge base and cite doc_id and title.

Safety
- Educational only; not a substitute for clinician judgment.
- Do not provide individualized dosing or diagnosis.
- Remind to check allergies and renal function; mask PHI/PII.

Tone
- Plain language at ~6thâ€“8th grade reading level.

Output
- 4â€“6 concise bullets plus "Evidence" with doc_id â€” title â€” URL.
```
2. Click the *Save* button in the top right.

#### Add examples

> **Why Add User Input and Model Response Examples?**  
> Examples serve as training scenarios that teach your AI assistant how to handle specific situations correctly. By providing sample conversations (both appropriate responses and proper refusals), you're creating a reference library that helps the AI understand your expectations. This is especially critical in healthcare, where the AI must know when to provide educational information versus when to refuse requests for individualized medical advice that could be harmful.

1. Click the *Add example* link to add the following examples.
![Add Example](/images/add-example.png)

2. Click the *Save* button in the top right after creating each of the examples.

##### Example 1

*User Input*

```text
Is semaglutide available on formulary for weight management, and who qualifies?
```


*Model response*

```text
Preferred agent is semaglutide weekly. Prior auth requires BMI â‰¥30 or â‰¥27 with a comorbidity; screen for contraindications.

Evidence: S3-01 â€” Formulary â€” GLP-1 Agonists
```


##### Example 2

*User Input*

```text
My aunt weighs 52 kg and has CrCl 28â€”what exact apixaban dose should she take?
```


*Model response*

```text
Refusal + reason: educational only; cannot provide individualized dosing; advise consulting a clinician.
```


#### Inference parameters

> **Understanding Inference Parameters**  
> Inference parameters control how creative or conservative your AI assistant's responses will be. **Temperature** (0.3 in our case) controls randomness: lower values mean more predictable, consistent responses, which is crucial for healthcare information. **Top P** (0.9) limits the AI's word choices to the most probable options, preventing unusual or inappropriate language. **Maximum length** (2048) sets how long responses can be, ensuring the AI provides complete answers without being overly verbose.

1. We are now going to assign the following settings in the *Inference parameters* section.

2. Click the *Save* button in the top right after setting the parameters.


##### Randomness and diversity

- Temperature = **0.3**
- Top P = **0.9**
- Maximum length = **2048**

#### Data

> **What is a Bedrock Knowledge Base?**  
> A Knowledge Base is your AI's reference library. It is a collection of your organization's documents, policies, and information that the AI can search through to provide accurate, up-to-date answers. Instead of relying solely on the AI's general training, a Knowledge Base allows your assistant to access your specific formulary data, clinical guidelines, or device manuals. This ensures responses are grounded in your organization's actual policies and procedures, dramatically reducing errors and improving relevance for your healthcare teams.

#### Functions

> **What Are Functions?**  
> Functions enable your AI to take actions beyond just answering questions. In Bedrock, functions allow your AI app to interact with your hospital's systems, look up real-time information, and create tickets or orders. This is called "agentic" development because the AI becomes an active agent that can perform tasks on behalf of users. Functions connect your AI to APIs and databases, transforming it from a passive Q&A bot into an intelligent assistant that can accomplish real work within safety parameters you define.

We will now add agentic functions to the app. You have the option of using some pre-built functions, or building them on your own. 

##### Use Pre-built Functions

1. Under functions, select both **device_lookup** and **helpdesk_ticket**
![Select functions](/images/select-functions.png)
2. Click the *Save* button in the top right to save your progress.

## Biomed IT Device Monitor

> The Biomed IT Device Monitor shows nearâ€‘realâ€‘time API activity initiated by your agent. As you chat, the agent can call device and helpdesk APIs (via functions) to look up inventory, draft tickets, or take actions on your behalf, with information about those calls appearing here.

- Understand agentic behavior: see when the assistant performs function calls (e.g., `GET /biomed/devices/...` or `POST /helpdesk/tickets`).
- Verify endâ€‘toâ€‘end flow: confirm calls succeed (2xx) and respond quickly; troubleshoot 4xx/5xx if they occur.
- Practice safe operations: use this view to validate that actions match the conversation and align with policy.
